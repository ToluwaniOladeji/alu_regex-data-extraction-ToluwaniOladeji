# DataExtractor

A lightweight Python utility for extracting structured data (emails, URLs, phone numbers, credit cards, times, hashtags, and currency values) from text files using **regular expressions (regex)**.  

---

## Features  
- Extract **emails**  
- Extract **URLs (http/https)**  
- Extract **phone numbers** (multiple formats)  
- Extract **credit card numbers**  
- Extract **12-hour & 24-hour times**  
- Extract **hashtags**  
- Extract **currency values**  
- Removes duplicates & sorts results  
- Saves results into a **JSON file**  
- Includes a **demo mode** with sample data  

---

## Requirements  
- Python **3.6+**  
- No external libraries required (standard library only 🎉)  

---

## Usage  

### 1. Clone or download this repo  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-folder>
```

### 2. Run with a text file as input  
```bash
python3 extractor.py yourfile.txt
```

If no file is provided, the script will:  
- Prompt you for one, or  
- Use `sample_data.txt` (auto-generated) if you press **Enter**.

## Example Output  

```
Processing file: sample_data.txt
EXTRACTION RESULTS
========================================

Emails: 2 found
  • support@company.com
  • sales@business.co.uk

URLs: 2 found
  • https://www.example.com
  • https://blog.example.org/posts

Phones: 3 found
  • (555) 123-4567
  • 555-987-6543
  • 555.111.2222
```

A JSON file is also generated:  
```
results_sample_data.json
```

---

## Demo Mode  
To test quickly, just run:  
```bash
python3 extractor.py
```
If `sample_data.txt` doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically.  

---

## Project Structure  
```
extractor.py        # Main script
sample_data.txt     # Auto-generated demo file (if missing)
results_*.json      # Extraction results in JSON format
```

---

## Extending the Extractor  
To add new patterns, edit the `self.patterns` dictionary inside the `DataExtractor` class. Example:  

```python
'ip_address': re.compile(r'\b\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}\b')
```
